## Why I wrote this app:

I wanted to create a web application that could be useful to people and besides that I could practice the basics of React well. Since I also like to write lists and track my progress, I wanted to make a learning aid application, the target group of which was mainly high school and university students.

## Functions:

* They can give you the name and date of the exam.

* A counter shows how many days are left until the exam.

* Items within the exam can be added

* On the items, they can state whether they already have the item.

* Percentage slider and color-coded  in one:
  
   * Inside the items there is a slider on which they can set the percentage of their current level of knowledge, and this is color-coded so that they know at a glance which item needs to be reviewed more. On top of that, they can see their level of knowledge projected onto the entire exam.

* Within the groups, you can randomly draw one of the items (
