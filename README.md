# Exam Preparatin

## The application is available here:

https://cintia-sari.github.io/exam-preparation-react/#

## Why I wrote this app:

I have created a web application that is useful to people. Besides, I could practice the basics of React as well. I created a learning aid application, because I like writing lists and tracking my progress. The target group of this application is high school and university students.

## functionalization:

* Users can give you the name and date of the exam.

* A counter shows how many days are left until the exam.

* Items can be added within the exam.

* You can indicate if you have complited the notes for a given topic.

* Color codeing persently slider:
  
   * Inside the items there is a slider on which they can set the percentage of their current level of knowledge, and this is color-coded so that they know at a glance which item needs to be reviewed more. On top of that, they can see their level of knowledge projected onto the entire exam.

* Within a groups, you can randomly draw one of the items
